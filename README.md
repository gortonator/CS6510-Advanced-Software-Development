## Introduction
ASD is designed to integrate academic concepts and practical experience of software engineering by having students work as part of a sizeable agile programming team, with options to lead a subteam. The course offers students an opportunity to study, in-depth, some aspects of the development process pertinent to a complex, ill-defined set of system requirements. The goal is to have students participate in a large-scale project, taking time to reflect and analyze the work and the process, and to produce a significant demonstrable outcome in the form of a working, deployed software system.

## Project
Each class works collaboratively to build a software project for an external client. The project description for the Spring 2020 Semester is [here](https://gortonator.github.io/CS6510-Advanced-Software-Development/ClimateTree), and here's the [initial class presentation on ClimateTree](https://gortonator.github.io/CS6510-Advanced-Software-Development/ClimateTree-Concept.pdf) and an [interesting discussion on the background ideas](https://vimeo.com/366564507).

## Prerequesites
Students should have completed FSE and/or a coop/intern. These prerequisites can be waived based on individual circumstances and experience such as that gained on COOPs or in other courses such as Web Development, Data Mining/Machine learning. Please contact the Professors to discuss

## Attendance 
Students are expected to attend each class on campus. If there is avalid reason, then a student may request to attend class remotely. All classes are held via video conference across participating campus locations.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of the course, students will have acquired the following knowledge:

### Advanced Software Engineering
- Be able to design and develop distributed, multi-tier, cloud-based systems
- Be able to design RESTful APIs that are robust and high performance
- Understand the advantages of continuous development and deployment
- Have experience with continous build/intergration platforms
- Be able to quantitavely assess and evolve a software system based on metrics
- Be able to design systems for usability and scalability
- Be able to explain the advantages and pitfalls of distributed teams
- Experience in distributed systems testing

### Experiential
- practical experience with scaled agile methods and tools
- acting as team technical lead
- task definition, prioritization and planning
- automated build tools
- designing and developing components in a complex software system
- retrospectives and code reviews

## Assessment
There will be major deliverables, in week 3, 7, 11, 14. These will be based on the following criteria:

1. **Week 3**: User stories defined, development frameworks and build tools environments established, plan for first sprint in place based on prioritized defined tasks. (10%).
1. **Week 7**: Initial demonstrable prototype that supports high priority user stories; retrospective on first sprint; plan for next sprint established (15%)
1. **Week 10**: Robust implementations of high priority user stories; demonstrations of medium priority user stories; integration of components across teams (20%)
1. **Week 14**: Final implementation of high and medium priority user stories; quality of resulting architecture and design; (25%)

There will also be an individual assessment based on contribution reports each sprint from each student. (30%)
