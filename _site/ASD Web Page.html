<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">Advanced Software Development</h1>
<h3 style="font-family:verdana;">Professor Ian Gorton</h3>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> 
Email: i.gortonATnortheastern.edu
</p>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Introduction</h2>

<p style="font-family:arial;">Designed to integrate academic concepts and practical experience of software design by having students work as part of a sizeable agile programming team, with an option to lead a subteam. Offers students an opportunity to study, in-depth, some aspects of the development process. The goal is to have students participate in a large-scale project, taking time to reflect and analyze the work and the process, and to produce a significant demonstrable outcome in the form of a working software system. 
</p>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Project</h2>
<p style="font-family:arial;">Each class works collaboratively to build a software project for an external client. The list of projects specification is <a href="#Proj"> below</a>.
</p>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Prerequesites</h2>
<p style="font-family:arial;">Ideally students should have completed MSD. These prerequisites can be waived based on individual circumstances and experience such as that gained on COOPs or in other courses such as Web Development, Data Mining/Machine learning. Please contact the Professor to discuss 
</p>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Learning Objectives</h2>
<p style="font-family:arial;">At the end of the course, students will have acquired the following knowledge: 

<h4 style="font-family:verdana;">Technical</h4>
<ul>
 <li style="font-family:arial;">Distributed, multi-tier system design and development  </li>
 <li style="font-family:arial;">RESTful API   design and development   </li>
 <li style="font-family:arial;">Cloud application design and development  </li>
 <li style="font-family:arial;">Data analysis and visualization   </li>
 <li style="font-family:arial;">Designing for  usability and scalability  </li>
 <li style="font-family:arial;">Distributed systems testing</li>
</ul>



<h4 style="font-family:verdana;">Software Engineering</h4>
<ul>
	<li style="font-family:arial;">practical experience with agile methods and tools   </li>
	<li style="font-family:arial;">acting as team   technical lead   </li>
	<li style="font-family:arial;">task definition, prioritization and planning  </li>
	<li style="font-family:arial;">automated  build tools   </li>
	<li style="font-family:arial;">retrospectives   and code reviews </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Assessment</h2>
<p style="font-family:arial;">There will be major deliverables, in week 4, 7, 10, 14. These will be based on the following criteria: 
<ul>
<li style="font-family:arial;"> Week 4:User stories defined, development frameworks and build tools environments established, plan for first sprint in place based   on prioritized defined tasks. (10%). </li>
<li style="font-family:arial;"> Week 7: Initial demonstrable prototype that supports high priority user stories; retrospective on first sprint; plan for next sprint established (15%) </li>
<li style="font-family:arial;"> Week 10:Robust implementations of high priority user stories; demonstrations of medium priority user stories; integration of   components across teams (25%) </li>
<li style="font-family:arial;"> Week 14:Final implementation of high and medium priority user stories; quality of resulting architecture and design; (30%) </li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> 
There will also be an individual assessemnt based on contribution reports each spring from each student. (5%x4)

 <h2 id="Proj"style="font-family:verdana;">Project Descriptions</h2>
 <h3 style="font-family:verdana;">Spring 2018</h3>
 
 <p style="font-family:arial;"> 
<a href="https://www.democracylab.org/index/?section=AboutProject&id=69"> TruthTree/Vizipedia</a> <br>

Check out the link above and the associated presentation here. The basic project requirements are:

<ol>
<li  style="font-family:arial;">Create a visual, data driven version of Wikipedia</li>
<li style="font-family:arial;">Allow users to interactively explore complex data sets, run regressions/correlations/etc, and visualize them in various ways through a web browser. </li>
<li style="font-family:arial;">Save interesting visualizations and create ‘pages’ that are persisted, with added optional commentary, so they are available to be searched/viewed and become part of the dataset.</li>
<li style="font-family:arial;">Share persisted visualizations/pages on social media (the opposite of #FakeNews) </li>
<li style="font-family:arial;">Make the whole system usable, available, secure, scalable </li>
<li style="font-family:arial;">And other features we dream up! </li>
</ol>

<p style="font-family:arial;"> 
The initial data set to be used covers Government investment data over 30+ years at multiple levels (state, city, county) for the whole USA. You can read about it and download it from  The Willamette Public Finance Database <a href="http://willamette.edu/mba/research-impact/public-datasets/">here</a>. It’s a biggie – first challenge for all your data nerds is to devise a way to ingest, store, update and query this efficiently.

The project has a small volunteer team working here in Seattle, but progress is very initial. They will be available to guide us from a client perspective, and help with some technical choices as there are several very experienced engineers involved.
