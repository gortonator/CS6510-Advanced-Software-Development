<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>ASD is designed to integrate academic concepts and practical experience of software engineering by having students work as part of a sizeable agile programming team, with options to lead a subteam. The course offers students an opportunity to study, in-depth, some aspects of the development process pertinent to a complex, ill-defined set of system requirements. The goal is to have students participate in a large-scale project, taking time to reflect and analyze the work and the process, and to produce a significant demonstrable outcome in the form of a working, deployed software system.</p>

<h2 id="project">Project</h2>
<p>Each class works collaboratively to build a software project for an external client. The project description for the Spring 2020 Semester is <a href="https://gortonator.github.io/CS6510-Advanced-Software-Development/ClimateTree">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="prerequesites">Prerequesites</h2>
<p>Students should have completed FSE and/or a coop/intern. These prerequisites can be waived based on individual circumstances and experience such as that gained on COOPs or in other courses such as Web Development, Data Mining/Machine learning. Please contact the Professors to discuss</p>

<h2 id="attendance">Attendance</h2>
<p>Students are expected to attend each class on campus. If there is avalid reason, then a student may request to attend class remotely. All classes are held via video conference across participating campus locations.</p>

<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>At the end of the course, students will have acquired the following knowledge:</p>

<h3 id="advanced-software-engineering">Advanced Software Engineering</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Be able to design and develop distributed, multi-tier, cloud-based systems</li>
  <li>Be able to design RESTful APIs that are robust and high performance</li>
  <li>Understand the advantages of continuous development and deployment</li>
  <li>Have experience with continous build/intergration platforms</li>
  <li>Be able to quantitavely assess and evolve a software system based on metrics</li>
  <li>Be able to design systems for usability and scalability</li>
  <li>Be able to explain the advantages and pitfalls of distributed teams</li>
  <li>Experience in distributed systems testing</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="experiential">Experiential</h3>
<ul>
  <li>practical experience with scaled agile methods and tools</li>
  <li>acting as team technical lead</li>
  <li>task definition, prioritization and planning</li>
  <li>automated build tools</li>
  <li>designing and developing components in a complex software system</li>
  <li>retrospectives and code reviews</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>
<p>There will be major deliverables, in week 3, 7, 11, 14. These will be based on the following criteria:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Week 3</strong>: User stories defined, development frameworks and build tools environments established, plan for first sprint in place based on prioritized defined tasks. (10%).</li>
  <li><strong>Week 7</strong>: Initial demonstrable prototype that supports high priority user stories; retrospective on first sprint; plan for next sprint established (15%)</li>
  <li><strong>Week 10</strong>: Robust implementations of high priority user stories; demonstrations of medium priority user stories; integration of components across teams (20%)</li>
  <li><strong>Week 14</strong>: Final implementation of high and medium priority user stories; quality of resulting architecture and design; (25%)</li>
</ol>

<p>There will also be an individual assessment based on contribution reports each sprint from each student. (30%)</p>

<br />
There’s an extensive body of work on developing quality code. Here’s some examples that are worth dipping in to, and are typical books on any good engineer’s book shelf <br />
Code Complete, by Steve McConnell. <br />
Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code , by Martin Fowler. <br />
Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software , by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides. <br />
Object-Oriented Design Heuristics , by Arthur Riel. <br />

This material should give you some insights into unit testing approaches and tools you can use: <br />
