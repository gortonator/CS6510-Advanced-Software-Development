<p>#<strong>Advanced Software Development</strong> 
##<strong>Spring 2017</strong>
<strong>Professor:</strong> Ian Gorton, i.gorton@northeastern.edu
<strong>Piazza:</strong> on its way</p>

<h3 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>Designed to integrate academic concepts and practical experience of software design by having students work as part of a sizeable agile programming team, with an option to lead a subteam. Offers students an opportunity to study, in-depth, some aspects of the development process. The goal is to have students participate in a large-scale project, taking time to reflect and analyze the work and the process, and to produce a significant demonstrable outcome in the form of a working software system.</p>

<p>###<strong>2017 Project</strong>
The class will build a cloud-based data managment and analysis platform for massive-scale scientific data sets. The AWS EC2 cloud wil be develpment/delivery  platform. A project specification can be <a href="https://github.com/gortonator/CS6510-Advanced-Software-Development/blob/master/docs/CS6510ProjectDescription2017.md">here</a>.</p>

<p>###<strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>

<p>Ideally students should have completed MSD. These prerequisites can be waived based on individual circumstances and experience such as that gained on COOPs or in other courses such as Web Development, Data Mining/Machine learning. Please contact Ian Gorton to discuss (i.gorton@neu.edu).</p>

<p>###<strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> 
At the end of the course, students will have acquired the following knowledge:</p>

<p><strong>Technical:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Distributed, multi-tier system design and development</li>
  <li>RESTful API   design and development</li>
  <li>Cloud application design and development</li>
  <li>Data analysis and visualization</li>
  <li>Designing for  usability and scalability</li>
  <li>Distributed systems testing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Software Engineering:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>practical experience with agile methods and tools</li>
  <li>acting as team   technical lead</li>
  <li>task definition, prioritization and planning</li>
  <li>automated  build tools</li>
  <li>retrospectives   and code reviews</li>
</ul>

<p>###<strong>Assessment</strong></p>

<p>There will be major deliverables, in week 4, 7, 10, 14. These will be based on the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Week 4:</strong> User stories defined, development frameworks and build tools environments established, plan for first sprint in place based   on prioritized defined tasks. (20%).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Week 7:</strong> Initial demonstrable prototype that supports high priority user stories; retrospective on first sprint; plan for next   sprint established (20%).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Week 10:</strong> Robust implementations of high priority user stories; demonstrations of medium priority user stories; integration of   components across teams (20%)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Week 14:</strong> Final implementation of high and medium priority user stories; quality of resulting architecture and design; (30%)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Week 11</strong> will require each team to perform a team retrospective and cross-team code reviews. This activity will form the final 10% of   the grade.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software , by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides. <br />
